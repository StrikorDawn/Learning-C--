# Overview

I created a simple calculator with a functional GUI in c++. It allows you to make all simple calculations a basic calculator would.

I wrote this program because I wanted to learn how to utilize GUI's better and I wanted to learn C++ along the way so it helped me accomplish both.

# Future Work

- Need to figure out how to allow continuous calculations (You don't have to hit enter between every operand input)
- Add more advanced calculations.
- Find a way to make the C and CE buttons actually have different uses.
- Figure out how to stop the error box from showing up when equals is hit directly after an operand.
